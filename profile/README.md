# Graveboards

## Project Scope
- **Features:**
  - Create a website called Graveboards, where we show beatmap pages and profile pages and display scores and leaderboards, while also creating a new homepage alternative to osu! website.
  - Create filters in our own database so that finding maps becomes easier for everyone.
  - Create new star rating and pp system.
  - Create social media features such as playlists, likes, favorites, etc.
  - Create map previews so people will see and check the map before downloading it.
  - Create an algorithm for beatmaps recommendations.

- **Limitations:**
  - We don't aim to replace bancho or the main branch of osu! like a private server. We aim to expand the current possibilities that bancho allow us to do.

## Timeline and Milestones
- **Phases:**
  - Phase 1: Modding Queue website. Launch graveboards.net as a modding queue website where we get the first users to Interact with our systems.
  - Phase 2: Launch beatmap pages with leaderboards. At this point, we have all the database ready to receive scores and track beatmap versions.
  - Phase 3: Launch profile pages with all relevant stats and features. At this point, we want all the human curation systems to be done and ready for use.
  - Phase 4: Launch complete filter system. At this point, we want our database to have a lot of data and we have all the requirements to filter them with our goals.
  - Phase 5: Launch brand new homepage. At this point we want to have our algorithms trained and ready to show on front page recommended mapsets.

## Marketing and Outreach
- **Community Engagement:** We plan to use BN modding queues as a way to engage with the mapper side of the Community in our project. As soon as the score tracking and leaderboard displays are ready, we plan to engage with players to test our systems.
- **User Feedback:** All feedback should be directed in our discord server to keep improving the project.

## Funding and Resources
- **Funding Needs:** For now we're doing this as a passion project as well as a potential portfolio project showcase as well.
- **Resource Needs:** foss contributed with the domain purchase, but we would be grateful to have contributions on its renewall.
